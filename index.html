<h2>Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
<p class="text-justify">
  I'm an Italian computer engineer and I work as 
  sofware architect and back-end developer for an Italian company leader 
  in software and IT services. 
  I have a wonderful wife and two beautiful children, which keep 
  me busy for most of my spare time :-). 
  I'm a very active person and I like almost all kinds of sports, 
  but my favourites are trekking and mountain bike. 
  I love photography and my family is my main subject. 
  I decided to create this website to collect and make available all my 
  personal information and to add a little blog to keep in touch with 
  the world.
